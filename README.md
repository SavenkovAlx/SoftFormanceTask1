# SoftFormanceTask1

Write a program that takes 4 inputs, where each input consists of 2 numbers in the format x,y. You are required to print a two-dimensional array having x rows and y columns for each input. The elements of the arrays should be whole numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1.
                        
Example
                        
Suppose the following 4 inputs are given to the program:
                        
2,2

2,3

3,3

3,4
                        
Then, the output of the program should be:
                        
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]

[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]
                        
Note: You should assume that input to the program is from console input (raw_input)
